# Product Classification Project

## Overview  
This project utilizes a dataset collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/retail-products-classification/data), which includes various categories, product titles, and product descriptions. The objective of the product classification is to accurately determine the category based on the provided product description, with the option to integrate various LLM models.

## Current Limitations  
- **Code Quality:** The current code requires significant improvements and refactoring.  
- **Evaluation:** The model is not evaluated accurately, and the evaluation results are not stored properly.  
- **Reference for Beginners:** Although the project serves as a reference for beginners on integrating LLM models with .NET, it needs enhancements for production-level performance.

## Improved Code is Present in **aspire_integration_productclassification**.

      "Description": "The Niagara Cutter D400 TiN-coated high-speed steel double-end square end mill has four flutes, a 30-degree helix angle, and a non-center-cutting design for general-purpose machining on a wide range of materials. Four flutes produce a better finish than fewer flutes. The general-purpose TiN coating combines stability at high temperatures with hardness for wear protection, increasing tool life and performance compared to uncoated end mills. (TiN is suitable for a range of materials, but TiCN or uncoated end mills are recommended for machining aluminum.) High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. The double-end design has cutting edges on both ends, allowing a new cutting surface to be substituted when the first shows wear, which doubles the tool’s life compared to single-end square end mills. The tool’s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts.The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles’ strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles’ increased cutting action. The non-center-cutting design is for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, and can also be used for profiling and slotting. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001” to -0.000”. This tool has a Weldon shank.End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool’s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive.",

      "Reason": "It is a cutting tool used in industrial settings."

      "Description": "MXR ZW44 Zakk Wylde Overdrive Pedal Whether on his groundbreaking work with Ozzy Osbourne or with his own Black Label Society, Zakk Wylde's guitar playing is loud, tough, and relentless. Zakk's take-no-prisoners attitude extends to his quest for tone, too. When he wanted to develop his signature overdrive pedal, he looked no further than Dunlop. The result is the new Wylde Overdrive. This muscular stompbox will turn your clean amp into a heavy, chunky crunch machine. Or, use it like Zakk does and kick it in front of a dirty amp for a screaming, sustaining lead tone. The three simple controls - Output, Tone, and Drive - make getting up and running easy, so you can concentrate on the business at hand. MXR ZW44 Zakk Wylde Overdrive Controls Footswitch toggles effect on/hardwire bypass (red LED indicates on) Output knob sets total output level Drive knob controls amount of distortion Tone knob tailors overall EQ",

      "Description": "Natural wooden baby spoons. Enjoy these handcrafted wooden spoons with unique hand design. Made here in the USA with Pennsylvania light wood. We special-ordered these baby spoons unfinished (normally they are finished w/ mineral oil which we don't like to use for babies), so this way you can decide if you would like a finish applied or not. Some people like to use olive oil or coconut oil, or we have an all-natural beeswax polish available at the bottom of the page (or we can apply the beeswax to your spoon at no extra cost). For care of wood spoons, avoid prolonged periods of moisture (wash briefly without soaking, and dry w/ towel after use). We ship the spoons in a padded recycled-paper jewelry box for extra protection (the box also looks nice when the spoon is for a baby gift)\n\nEvery item is made from the finest materials including, 18/10 Stainless Steel, Porcelain, Hand Crafted Clay and many others. We strive to bring each consumer an item that has been tested and used by our staff and insured to be enjoyed by you and your family.",

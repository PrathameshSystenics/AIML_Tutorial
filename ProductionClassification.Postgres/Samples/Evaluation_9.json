      "Description": "Unlike most electric massagers, this Panasonic has a  telescoping handle that encourages effortless massage of  difficult-to-reach areas. The handle has two grips, so both hands can apply pressure  for a penetrating massage. The user can apply pressure to the lower  back, for instance, by gripping the handle with both hands and pulling  in the same manner as one would close a pair of pants. Retracted, the  handle measures 26 inches. Fully extended, it measures 42 inches. Each  grip pulls out separately. The massage head measures 5 by 2-1/2 inches  and has three large massaging nodes. The simple push of a button heats  the head, applying soothing warmth to a wide area. There's also a  high/low button to vary vibration intensity. The head also flexes to  adjust to body contours. The lightweight massager has a loop on the  handle for hanging on a hook or peg, and carries a one-year warranty  against defects.--Fred Brack",

Give your hair total range with the Conair CS9CS Shiny Styles crimper/straightener. This styling tool features four sets of easily changed plates--three that let you go wavy, straight, or crimped, and a fourth pair with a gentle star surface to make hair shine. Conair's straightforward design makes it easy to switch styling techniques, too. Just press each plate's release button, slide it off, and fit a new one into the plate grooves. The iron's handle is light and manageable and works for left- or righthanders. Designed for use only when hair is dry, the iron works well on naturally curly, straight, or wavy locks.--Emily Bedard
